<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This catalogue describes the paintings in the Gallery of Art of The New
York Historical Society, with two hundred and eighty-six miniatures,
comprising the Mari&eacute; Collection and seventy-six objects of Sculpture.</p>

<p>The New York Gallery of Fine Arts, presented to the Society in 1858,
with paintings donated to the Society at various times, are numbered
1 to 488 inclusive. Any notice of this collection would be deficient
which should fail to commemorate the name of Luman Reed, Patron of
American Art. In this connection the Society was chiefly indebted to the
liberality and cordial co&ouml;peration of one of their most valued members,
who was himself the chief promoter of the original design of the New
York Gallery of Fine Arts, Mr. Jonathan Sturges.</p>

<p>The Bryan Collection, presented to the Society in 1867 by the late
Thomas J. Bryan, numbers three hundred and eighty-one paintings and are
designated by the letter B. before each number.</p>

<p>The Durr Collection, presented to the Society in 1882 by the executors
of the late Louis Durr, numbers, with subsequent additions, one hundred
and eighty-one paintings, which are designated by the letter D. before
each number.</p>

<p>Short biographical sketches of deceased artists represented in the above
collections have been added, together with indexes to Artists, portraits
and donors.</p>

<p>The Mari&eacute; Collection of miniatures is arranged alphabetically by
subjects and is not included in the index of portraits.</p>

<h2><a name="LUMAN_REED" id="LUMAN_REED">LUMAN REED</a></h2>


<p>Luman Reed was born in Green River, Columbia County, N. Y., in 1785,
and died in 1836. He removed when a boy to Coxsackie, N. Y., where he
was educated in an ordinary school at the expense of an uncle. Later he
was employed in a country store and subsequently became the partner and
brother-in-law of his employer.</p>

<p>He made frequent trips to New York City on a sloop called the
"Shakespeare," belonging to the firm, selling produce of the farms
around Coxsackie and purchasing goods in New York for his country store.
Later he became a merchant in New York and between the years 1815 and
1832 he gained a fortune. It was then that he began to gratify other
instincts and art attracted his attention. He became the patron of
American Art and sought the acquaintance of artists, interesting himself
in their labors, giving them many commissions for work.</p>

<p>Mr. Reed lived at 13 Greenwich Street, this city, the third story of
which building he used as a picture gallery, to which visitors were
admitted one day each week. This room was also a meeting place for the
artists and literary men of the time. The paintings after Mr. Reed's
death were purchased by his friends and subsequently constituted the
New York Gallery of Fine Arts which, after an uncertain existence of
about twelve years, was forced to close its affairs. Eighty of these
paintings, presented in 1858, are now in the possession of this Society
and known as the New York Gallery of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>The death of Mr. Reed was greatly lamented by the artists of his time
and his name has come down to this generation as the Patron of American
Art.</p>

<p>1-5. The Course of Empire. <i>Thomas Cole.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A series of five pictures, illustrating a nation's rise,
progress, greatness, decline, and fall, and the consequent changes
in the same landscape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The isolated rock, crowning a precipitous

</div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>Reed Collection.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>New York Gallery of Fine Arts.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<h3>[FIRST OF THE SERIES.]</h3>

<p>1. The "Savage State," or "Commencement of Empire." (61&frac12;X39.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The sun is rising from the sea, over a wild scene of rocks,
forests, and mountains, dissipating the clouds and darkness of
night. Man, attired in skins, is seen engaged in the wild dance
and the chase&mdash;the characteristic occupations of the savage life.
In the picture, we have the first rudiments of society. Men have
banded together for mutual aid. The useful arts have commenced in
the construction of the canoe, the weapon, and the hut; and we may
imagine the germs of two of the fine arts, music and poetry, in the
singing usually accompanying the dance of the savage. The empire
is asserted, to a limited extent, over sea, land, and the animal
kingdom. It is the season of Spring&mdash;the morning of the nation's
existence.</p></blockquote>

<h3>[SECOND OF THE SERIES.]</h3>

<p>2. "The Arcadian," or "Pastoral State." (62&frac12;X39.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ages have passed; a change has been wrought in the scene&mdash;man
has subjugated "the untracked and rude." We now see the shepherd
and his flocks; the ploughman upturning the soil, and the wafting
sail; by the shore a village, and on the hill the ascending smoke
of sacrifice. In this picture we have agriculture, commerce, and
religion. In the aged man describing the mathematical figure, the
rude attempt of the boy in drawing; in the female figure with the
distaff, the vessel on the stocks; in the primitive temple, and the
dance of the peasants to the music of the pipe, we have evidence of
the advance made in science, in the useful and the fine arts.</p>

<p>It is early Summer, and the sun has ascended midway to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>meridian.</p></blockquote>

<h3>[THIRD OF THE SERIES.]</h3>

<p>3. "The Consummation of Empire." (75X50&frac12;.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The rude village has become a magnificent city. From the
bay&mdash;now a capacious harbor, with <i>phari</i> at the entrance, and
thronged with war-galleys, and barks with silken sails&mdash;ascend
piles of architecture, temples, domes, and colonnades. The massive
bridge, the streets and squares, lined with palaces and adorned
with statuary, clustered columns, and sparkling fountains, are
crowded with gorgeous pageants and triumphal processions. It
is a day of triumph&mdash;man has conquered man&mdash;nations have been
subjugated. By wealth and power, knowledge, art, and taste, man has
achieved the summit of human grandeur.</p>

<p>The sun is near the meridian.</p></blockquote>

<h3>[FOURTH OF THE SERIES.]</h3>

<p>4. "Destruction." (62&frac12;X38&frac12;.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ages have passed away since the scene of glory. Luxury has
enervated, vice has debased, and the strength of the mighty nation
has consumed away. A barbarous enemy sacks the city. The heavens
are darkened by a tempest, and the storm of war rages beneath, amid
falling walls and colonnades, and the flames of temples and palaces.</p></blockquote>

<h3>[FIFTH OF THE SERIES.]</h3>

<p>5. "Desolation." (61X39&frac12;.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The moon ascends the twilight sky, near where the sun rose in
the first picture. The last rays of the departed sun illumine a
lonely column of the once proud city, on whose capital the heron
has built her nest. The shades of evening steal over shattered and
ivy-grown ruins. The steep promontory, with its insulated rock,
still rears against the sky, unmoved, unchanged; but violence and
time have crumbled the works of man, and art is again resolving
into elemental nature. The gorgeous pageant has passed; the roar of
battle has ceased; the multitude has sunk in the dust; the empire
is extinct.</p></blockquote>

<p>Steenwyck was prominent in the early annals of New York as
Burgomaster, etc., under the Dutch, and Member of the Assembly,

This picture is supposed to have been painted at Haarlem, Holland,
1667-1668, at which time Steenwyck was visiting his sister,
the wife of the artist Van Goosen. It remained for more than a
century in the family of Colonel Anthony White, from one of whose
descendants&mdash;Miss Isabella J. Evans, of New Brunswick, N. J.&mdash;it
came into the possession of the Society in December, 1882.</p>

<p>The portrait is surmounted by the arms of Steenwyck, and below
it is a view of the city of New Amsterdam, from a sketch made about
1656. The head of Steenwyck, No. 265 of this Catalogue, seems to

<h2><a name="THOMAS_J_BRYAN" id="THOMAS_J_BRYAN">THOMAS J. BRYAN</a></h2>


<p>Thomas Jefferson Bryan was the son of Guy Bryan and Martha Matlock, his
wife. He was born at "Spring Hill," Philadelphia, Pa., about 1800, and
died at sea, May 14, 1870, on board the French steamship "Lafayette,"
while on his way to New York, four days out from Havre, France.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryan graduated at Harvard University in 1823 and studied law, but
he never practiced his profession, as he had an adequate inheritance.</p>

<p>Much of his time was given to foreign travels in forming a valuable
collection of paintings. For a time this collection, known as the Bryan
Gallery of Christian Art, was displayed on the walls of a spacious room
in a house on the corner of Broadway and Thirteenth Street, where an
admission fee of twenty-five cents was charged to view the paintings,
Mr. Bryan himself being the custodian in charge. He next deposited them
in the Cooper Union, and in 1867 he deeded the entire collection to the
New York Historical Society, which he catalogued, arranged and added to
from time to time until his death in 1870.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, with the cruciform halo, and the elliptical
aureola, bordered with cherubim, appears in the heavens. Above, two
angels, strangely enough colored entirely blue, sound the trumpet;
below, the Virgin and <span class="smcap">St. John</span> kneel upon the ground, from
which rises the cross, on which two angels are looking. On the
left, the elect, wearing crowns of gold, mount towards the sky,
under the protection of a pitying spirit; on the right, the damned,
covered with blood, are delivered to the demons by a minister
of divine vengeance. <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> himself wears a terrible
expression. <span class="smcap">Michael Angelo</span> is, therefore, not the first
to have given him this menacing aspect. The general color of the
picture pleases the eye by its extreme fineness: the Virgin and
<span class="smcap">St. John</span> by the beauty of their types." To this just and
graphic description from the pen of M. Michiels, which appeared in
the <i>Gazette de France</i>, it is needless to add anything more. From

d'Alba.</i>]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Virgin <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <span class="smcap">St. John</span> the Baptist,
<span class="smcap">St. Jerome</span>, <span class="smcap">St. Joseph</span>, <span class="smcap">St. Michael</span>,
and the Pope <span class="smcap">Julius</span> II., are kneeling before the divine
infant. Three small Angels, also kneeling, carry the nails and the
Cross, emblems of the torture which the new-born should suffer. The
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> bears a striking resemblance to that of the little
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, so much admired, in a painting of the same artist,
now placed in the Louvre, after having decorated the gallery of
the King of Holland. <span class="smcap">St. Michael</span> strikes the beholder
by his noble air and his martial type. The head is evidently the
portrait of <span class="smcap">Gaston de Foix</span>, the model of the chivalry of
the day. <span class="smcap">St. John</span> is the lean prophet of the desert, the
ascetic, and the eater of locusts and wild honey. At the top of
the picture, three Angels play upon different instruments. In the
background are seen the Capitol, the image of Roman power, and the
vast ruins of the Coliseum. The head of <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, who stands
behind <span class="smcap">St. John</span>, must strike the considerate observer by
its close resemblance to the type of <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> which we find
in the Holy Families of <span class="smcap">Raphael</span>. In the Cherub who holds
the Cross, we also find great similarity to the little Angel who
occupies so prominent a position in the famous Madonna of Foglino,
from the same divine pencil. From the collection <span class="smcap">Errard</span>.

<p>In the centre of the upper compartment, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
draped in red, and bearing the emblematic banner of the Cross,
rises from an open tomb. His hand is raised with an expression of
command. On each side are two soldiers sleeping, and two starting
away in fright. A slender tree also is seen upon each side of the
tomb; in the distance is a large hill. In the lower compartment are
eight figures, besides the infant <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. Six kneel in a
semicircle about the new-born Saviour, who lies in the middle of
the foreground. Three of these, on the left, are shepherds. On the
right are the Virgin mother and two Angels. Next to <span class="smcap">Mary</span>
sits <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>; and on the extreme left, a fourth shepherd
approaches. Two slender trees here also appear on each side of the
composition. In the distance are heavily undulating hills.</p></blockquote>

the absence of some figures in the background, and the introduction

<p>B-43. Virgin and Child, with St. John. (10X81.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It will be noticed that gold is used freely in the halos, and
upon the draperies, which fall in somewhat stiff but ample and not
unpleasing folds. This picture is from the collection of the Abb&eacute;
<span class="smcap">Genoude</span>, known as the translator of the Bible, by which he

and was once improperly attributed to <span class="smcap">Raphael</span>. It bears
many of the marks of <span class="smcap">Garofalo's</span> pencil.</p>

<p>(<i>Bryan Collection.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>B-45. The Crucifixion. (33X23.) <i>Andrea Mantegna.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Michiels, the distinguished critic employed by the Belgian
Government to prepare a history of Flemish Art, says of this
work: "The <span class="smcap">Christ</span> has a nobility in his attitude which
few painters have been able to give him; the expression of the
good robber is also grave and dignified. The whole picture bears
the impress of a serene imagination; the coloring is sombre; the
attitudes are distinguished by an air of majesty. We feel that the
artist had, at the commencement of his career, severely studied the
ancients. Two cuirasses, and some of the draperies, are gilded;
gold is mingled with the other costumes, in the form of <i>traits,</i>
designating the folds. We are particular about these details,
because they indicate the primitive epoch in which the picture was
painted, and the manner in which they passed from the use of gold
grounds to the entire abandonment of that metal."</p>

<p>It should be observed that the Jewish type is preserved in
the heads of many of the figures, which is the case of the works
of very few other masters. It will be observed that there are in
this crowded canvas no two pieces of offensive or defensive armor
alike. This is worthy of particular remark, as <span class="smcap">Squarcioni</span>,
the master of <span class="smcap">Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> Tegna</span>, had the largest and most varied
collection of ancient arms which existed in his day.</p>

<p>Aside from its intrinsic merit, this picture is of the
greatest interest when considered in connection with the
<i>St. Jerome</i> (B-47) by <span class="smcap">Correggio</span>, the disciple of
<span class="smcap">Mantegna</span>. In the peculiar mode of introducing gold in the
lights of that noble painting, we notice an unmistakable similarity
to <span class="smcap">Mantegna's</span> use of the same material in the work before
us; thus showing the direct connection between the manner of the
two painters.</p>

<p>It is impossible to overrate the historical importance of
the juxtaposition of this work of <span class="smcap">Mantegna</span> with that of
<span class="smcap">Correggio</span>. There is afforded in no other gallery, public
or private, in the world, a similar opportunity to study the master
and scholar side by side in works of unquestionable authenticity
and the highest intrinsic merit.</p>

<p>B-47. The Virgin and Child, Mary Magdalen, and St. Jerome (known as the
St. Jerome). (19X14.) <i>Correggio.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of this sketch M. Michiels remarks, that in it "burns in all
its grace the talent of <i>Correggio</i>. Never has the Ecstasy of
piety, or the fervor of religious affection, been better expressed."</p>

<p>This picture differs from the large one at Parma, in the
absence of the emblematic lion which stands in that by the side
of <span class="smcap">St. Jerome</span>; and also in the color of some of the
draperies, particularly in that of the canopy, which in this is
striped, while in that it is of one color. In this, too, we find
gold used in the halos and in the draperies, which is not the case
in the other; a fact which points to the earlier production of this
picture, and which also connects it in a remarkable manner with the
<i>Crucifixion</i> by <i>Mantegna</i> (No. B-45).</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that this picture is the finished sketch
for the well-known <i>St. Jerome</i>, at Parma. The marked differences
already alluded to in minor points, prove incontestably that it
could not be the work of a copyist, who would, of course, reproduce
his original with all possible fidelity. It is from the collection
of Marshal Sebastiani, it having been nailed firmly to the wall in
his bed-chamber.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three angels bear aloft the interpreter of the divine will:
one has the form of infancy, another of youth, the third of
adolescence. The minister of our Lord raises his hands to heaven,
on which he gazes with an expression of burning hope. How he seeks
to discover the first rays of the eternal light! How he longs for
the moment in which he shall appear before the Almighty! What
enthusiasm animates his countenance! I doubt if the ardor of faith
could be better shown. The little angel has those brilliant eyes,
and that expressive visage, which this master knew so well how to
paint; it is certainly not inferior to those which we admire in the
grand salon of the Louvre. The angel of the second age charms the
eye by a grace and an easiness of attitude extremely remarkable;
upon his countenance burn the veneration and the love with which
the Apostle inspires him. The entire group seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> actually to mount
in the air. Mr. Bryan had the good taste to purchase it at the sale
of M. Forbin-Janson."</p>

<p>To this just and graphic description, from the pen of M.
Michiels, which appeared in the <i>Gazette de France</i>, it is needless
to add anything more.</p>

<p>This picture was formerly in the gallery of the Cardinal
Lambruschini, and afterwards in the collection of M. Forbin-Janson,
Director of the Louvre, at whose sale it was purchased by the donor.</p>

<p>The cross upon which the dead <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is suspended
occupies the middle of the composition. On the left, <span class="smcap">St.
John</span> sustains the fainting Virgin, behind whom kneels the
churchman for whom the picture was painted. His name, <i>Fr(ater)
Aurelius de Emael</i>, is written in German-text across his figure.
Behind him is a weeping female figure; on the left is a group of
dignitaries and soldiers. A landscape, in which the towers of a
distant city appear, closes the scene. Underneath the left arm
of the cross appears the legend, <i>Vere Filius Dei erat iste</i>,
in Roman characters of the epoch, which ceased to be used after
the time when the painting in oil commenced. The forms in the
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> are somewhat meagre, but the anatomy is remarkably
correct and particular. The expression in the faces of the several
figures is marked. Modern art rarely shows us finer expression.
The picture is slightly but admirably restored in the left arm of
the cross, and a portion of the legend. It is of unquestionable
authenticity and the extremest rarity.</p>

upon a celestial globe typical of the music of the spheres.</p>

on a careful examination, its wonderful energy and muscular

that of <span class="smcap">Rubens</span>. It is the Belvidere Torso&mdash;that only
acknowledged Master of <span class="smcap">Michael Angelo</span>&mdash;put into action,

<p>B-220. Head of Christ. (15X11.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is upon leather, which was stamped and gilded so as to
form around it a strange quadrangular halo, in which <i>fleur de
lis</i> is prominent. Upon the edge is an inscription, of which only
<span class="smcap">Adoro&mdash;Redentor</span>, I. H. S., is legible. It is probably not
older than the latter part of the fourteenth century, and was,
doubtless, an object of adoration to some devout Catholic.</p>

<p>B-221. Diana of Poictiers, as Judith with the Head of Holofernes.
(39X27.) <i>Martin Freminet.</i></p>

<p>B-222. The Repose in Egypt. (36&frac12;X30.) <i>Nicholas Poussin.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The attitude of the Virgin is remarkable, not only for its
graceful dignity, but for its perfect expression of the fact that
she is listening calmly but intently to the narrative which Joseph
is evidently relating. The landscape, though not highly finished,
is grandly composed; and upon it the twilight of dawn is made to
fall with sweet solemnity.</p>

<p>(<i>Bryan Collection.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>B-223. The Daughter of Pharaoh about to bathe in the Nile. (25&frac12;X29.)
<i>Nicholas Poussin.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Two attendants are about to disrobe the Princess; a third
kneels at her feet with a vase of anointing oil. Before her is
a figure emblematic of the river. The group is finely composed,
and the forms and attitudes are simple and chaste almost to
statuesqueness.</p>

<p>Both these pictures display the knowledge of form, the
classical taste, and the color which are characteristic of this
Master, recognized as the <i>Peintre des Gens d'Esprit</i>. This sketch
is in the best manner of <span class="smcap">Poussin</span>, and was formerly in the
collection of M. de St. Aubin.</p>

in the shadow on the left, and plays upon a pipe, is like
<span class="smcap">Claude</span>. <span class="smcap">Claude</span> was so conscious of the want of

<p>Adoration of the Magi. <i>Leonard Bramer.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Virgin, with the infant Christ and Joseph, sits in
front of a ruined building. Around them the Magi are grouped in
adoration. The distribution of the light in this little picture is
truly grand, and the color is rich and harmonious. The influence of
Rembrandt is apparent in every touch.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The sainted King starts from a canopied couch to gaze
upon the apparition of Pope <span class="smcap">Gregory</span> <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, who
appears before him, cloud-borne, and surrounded by angels. In the
background is a sentinel. This little picture is noble in style and
harmonious in color. The action of the figures is remarkably free
and vigorous.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Lace-Worker. <i>Peter De Hooghe.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young woman sits by an open window, with her hands
resting upon the cushion on which is her work. The light falls
in a broad mass upon one side of her face and figure, while the
other is in the half-shadow of reflected light. This little
sketch, so unobtrusive in subject and treatment, will impress
the close observer with a sense of great power and thorough
knowledge&mdash;knowledge which is content to know without seeming
learned.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miniature Portrait. <i>Balthazar Denner.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>An old man, wearing a cap, and a breastplate over a rich
doublet. This head is painted with an elaborateness of detail
worthy of Gerard Douw, while at the same time it is modelled with a
free and learned hand.</p>

<h2><a name="LOUIS_DURR" id="LOUIS_DURR">LOUIS DURR</a></h2>


<p>Louis Durr was born in Carlsruhe, Germany, in 1821, and died in New
York City, March 31, 1880. His father was the Treasurer of the Duke of
Baden-Baden, and was a watch-maker by trade, as well as a dealer in
works of art.</p>

<p>Mr. Durr graduated from the Lyceum in his native city, and after
visiting Geneva and Paris, came to this country with his brother in
1848 and for a time was connected with Balbach's gold smelting works in
Newark, N. J. In 1853-54 he was established at 111 Nassau Street, this
city, as a refiner of gold and silver. In 1856 he removed to 51 Ann
Street and the following year to 53 Ann Street, where he carried on his
business as an assayer and refiner for many years with his brother.</p>

<p>He accumulated a fortune and spent all his spare time studying and
collecting works of art. He lived at No. 30 East 4th Street, where he
kept his paintings.</p>

<p>He was a member of the Liederkranz Club, then near his home, and became
a member of this Society in 1873.</p>

<p>By will Mr. Durr directed that the most meritorious works of art were to
be selected from his gallery of paintings and placed by his executors in
some public art gallery, to be known as the "Durr Gallery of Paintings,"
the residue of his paintings to be sold and the proceeds invested for
the purchase of suitable additions for the "Durr Gallery of Paintings."</p>

<p>In 1880 the executors of his estate under the terms of his will offered
the collection of paintings to The New York Historical Society, and in
1882 they were transferred to the Society, together with the proceeds of
the above-mentioned sale, which the Society designated the "Durr Gallery
Fund" and from which the Gallery is added to.</p>

<p>The struggle of the German people in the year 1848 gave rise
to this allegorical composition. Germania, the Goddess of Germany,
awakened from her slumber on a bear's skin by Justice and Liberty,
seizes the national crown and sword, and drives away the demons of
Despotism and Discord. This picture was finished in 1849, when it
was purchased by Mr. John G. Boker, and brought by him to New York,
where for many years it was exhibited in the D&uuml;sseldorf Gallery.</p>

sadly upon his hand, the weary chase of life is over, he is dying&mdash;the
Great Spirit waits to conduct him to the far off hunting-grounds,
that dreamy land where souls repose in boundless prairies. His
tribe has disappeared, he is left alone, the solitary offshoot of a
mighty race; already the axe of the backwoodsman disturbs his last
hours; civilization, and art, and agriculture&mdash;all mysteries to him
incomprehensible&mdash;have desecrated his home, and the dark shadows of the
past gather him into their bosom!"&mdash;<i>London Art Journal.</i></p>

</div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>She is not in tears; but her aspect is that of one who listens
in sadness; her eyes are cast down, and her thoughts are of the
home of her youth in the land of Moab. Over her left arm hangs
a handful of the ears of wheat which she has gathered from the
ground, and her right rests on the drapery about her bosom. Nothing
can be more graceful than her attitude, or more expressive of
melancholy sweetness and modesty than her physiognomy."&mdash;<i>Extract
of a letter by Mr. W. C. Bryant, dated Rome, 1845.</i></p>

<p>This statue was purchased by Miss Hicks, of New York, and
presented to the New York Gallery of Fine Arts.</p></blockquote>

K. Brown.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This playful group was presented to the New York Gallery, by
C. M. Leupp, Esq. The boy has left his bowl of milk upon the floor,
and the dog is endeavoring to take advantage of his negligence,
by appropriating the contents to himself, against which the boy
stoutly protests. They are so equally matched in strength, that the
struggle is of doubtful issue, and therefore the artist calls it,
"<i>Chi Vinci, mangia</i>," or, who wins, eats.</p>
